   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>A five-ingredient hamburger rice casserole topped with melty cheese.<br>
    My grandma used to make this and it was always a hit. She uses American cheese,<br>
     but I make it with mozzarella. Very easy and yummy!</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice</li>
        <li>½ cup long grain white rice</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir<br>
             until evenly browned. Drain off grease, and stir in the cream of mushroom soup,<br>
              tomatoes, and uncooked rice. Cover, and simmer over low heat, stirring<br>
             occasionally, until rice is cooked, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven's broiler. When the rice is done cooking, transfer the contents<br>
             of the skillet to a casserole dish. Cover with a layer of cheese.</li>
        <li>Broil until the cheese is melted and toasty. Season with salt and pepper to taste,<br>
             and enjoy!</li>        
     </ol>
